  ## **Description**

  

  ### We were tasked with making an application for a user to create their team member profile through the CLI. We were to use what we have learned in JEST, Inquirer & Nodejs to complete this task. After the user is finished generating their team member profile, the results are saved to an html file for their use.

  ### Features in the applications:
  - User can create employees of the following roles: Manager, Engineer, & Intern.
  - User can check the employees they created through the CLI.
  - User can delete employees through the CLI.
  - To reduce errors, User must input correctly.
  - An HTML document is created upon completion with the employees ID, Name, Email, & more.
